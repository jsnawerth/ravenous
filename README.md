# Ravenous - A Restaurant Finder App using Yelp API

## Project Outline

Ravenous is a restaurant rating and reviews app that utilizes the Yelp Fusion API. It allows users to search for restaurants in their local area and access detailed information, ratings, and reviews.

## Tools Used

- React
- Yelp Fusion API

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite], a fast web development build tool.

## Features

- Location-based restaurant search: Users can search for restaurants based on a specific location.

## Future Work

Here are some potential enhancements for the Ravenous app in the future:

- Integration of Google Maps API: By integrating the Google Maps API, users can view the location of each restaurant on a map, providing a visual representation of their search results.

- User reviews: Implement a feature that allows users to add their own reviews and ratings for restaurants. This will enhance the community aspect of the app and provide valuable insights to other users.

Feel free to contribute to the project and suggest additional improvements!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Ravenous app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jsnawerth/ravenous.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Obtain a Yelp API key by signing up on the [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers) website.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Yelp API key as follows:
